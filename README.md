# webdevelopmentprojects

HI, these are just some of the small projects that I made when I started learning javascript and bootstrap.

res_boot.html - is a webpage I created with bootstrap.
swapiwithJQ.html - I used star wars api to display the name and image of a random character using JQuery.
swapiwithJS.html - I used star wars api to display random characters and planets using JavaScript.



Thanks!!
