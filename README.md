# webdevelopmentprojects

HI, these are just some of the small projects that I made when I started learning javascript and bootstrap.

**res_boot.html** - is a webpage created with bootstrap.

**swapiwithJQ.html** -  used star wars api to display the name and image of a random character using JQuery.

**swapiwithJS.html** -  used star wars api to display random characters and planets using JavaScript.



Thanks!!
